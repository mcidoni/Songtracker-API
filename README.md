## Planning Story

With this app, I was not looking to reinvent the wheel, but to incorporate some of my interests into this project. I kept with a music-focused theme for it as a nod to my love for music. Setting up a server was not as difficult as I anticipated it to be, however I did have to really pace myself to make sure I was doing things correctly during initial setup. I had much more fun with the styling of the client-side, and really wanted to give this app pops of color and a whimsical look. 

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB / Mongoose

### Unsolved Problems

- I want to add more routes to allow more search functionality, so users can look up songs by more specific criteria.
